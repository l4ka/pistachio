Usage:

	make linux
	LD_PRELOAD=../liballoc.so ./mtest

.. and then just ..

	./mtest

	... to compare the results between liballoc and
	    the default malloc/free implementations ...
	



This is an arbitrary test which does not simulate real-life 
events enough to fully guage the performance of the library.  
However, it's primarily used to test correctness.
