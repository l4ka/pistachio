This is a step-by-step instruction guide detailing how to
implement the library on your own system.


1. Copy the "liballoc.c" and "liballoc.h" files into
   your working directory. (Whatever project you want
   to use it in).

2. Create the hooks that the library needs:

     Make a new file called "liballoc_hooks.c" (or
	 whatever) and implement the functions detailed 
	 in the README and explained in "liballoc.h"

	 Look at "linux.c" for an example. It implements
	 the hooks for a Linux system.
	 
3. Be sure to include the "liballoc.h" header
   into your C/C++ files that are using the
   malloc/free/memory operations. (So that
   malloc/free/etc are declared.. obviously.)

4. Compile as per your normal method and test.
