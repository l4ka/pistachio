\brief Generic ELF library

The ELF library is designed to make the task of parsing and getting information
out of an ELF file easier.

It provides function to obtain the various different fields in the ELF header, and
the program and segment information.

Also importantly, it provides a function elf_loadFile which will load a given
ELF file into memory.
