============================================================================

uSTL is a partial implementation of the C++ standard library that focuses on
decreasing the memory footprint of user executables. While many projects can
use it to replace the standard library without any code changes, there exist
important differences that you should be aware of. Please read documentation
in docs/index.html (or online at http://msharov.github.io/ustl) before using
this library in your project.

uSTL ought to still compile under gcc as old as 2.95, but many features will
be unavailable. For best results, including C++11 support, use at least 4.6.
Clang 3.2 or later is also supported. There are no other dependencies.

Latest version:		https://github.com/msharov/ustl/releases/latest

./configure && make && make check && make install

Build configuration is in Config.mk and config.h, generated by configure.
