The library (all code under lib/ except xdr_private.h and
xdr_private.c) is derived from the XDR components of the
libtirpc package from Fedora 11 (libtirpc-0.1.10-7.fc11.src.rpm,
as patched by the rpm.spec and patches included in that package).
As patched, the libtirpc XDR code has been explicitly relicensed
by the copyright owner (Sun Microsystems) to a 3-clause BSD license.
This license is reproduced in full in each of the affected source
files, and is also available in licenses/sunrpc.

As documented in the libtirpc rpm.spec file from Fedora 11:
* Tue May 19 2009 Tom "spot" Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com> 0.1.10-7
- Replace the Sun RPC license with the BSD license, with the explicit
  permission of Sun Microsystems

The two exceptions, lib/xdr_private.h and lib/xdr_private.c, are
provided under the MIT/X license.  The full text of this license is
included in each source file to which it applies, and is also
available in licenses/MIT_X.

Some other files in this distribution, especially test programs,
may be licensed under certain other free licenses.  These are all
permissive, rather than copyleft, licenses.  See below for details.

All code under src/test/ is provided under the MIT/X license.  The
full text of that license is included in each source file, and may
also be found in licenses/MIT_X.

src/getopt.h
src/getopt_long.c
   These are derived from the NetBSD's libgetopt, and are provided
   under a 2-clause BSD license.  The full text of this license is
   included in each source file, and is also available in
   licenses/getopt.  These files are used only by the test programs,
   and only on those platforms that do not provide getopt (namely,
   mingw and msvc).  Original location:
     http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/libgetopt/files/

src/msvc/inttypes.h
src/msvc/stdint.h
   These are msvc-specific replacements for C99-standard
   headers that are missing from msvc 2005 (8.0) and earlier.
   They (or a suitable similar replacement) are required
   by the visual studio port of bsd-xdr (and should be installed
   along with rpc/xdr.h and rpc/types.h).  They are provided
   under a 3-clause BSD license.  The full text of that license
   is embedded in each source file, and is also available in
   licenses/msinttypes.  Original location:
     http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/  (rev. 24).

src/mkdtemp.c
   Derived from an implementation that is part of the 'discover'
   package (SVN rev. 879)
     http://svn.debian.org/viewsvn/pkg-discover/discover/trunk/portability/mkdtemp.c?view=markup
   and released under a 3-clause BSD license.  The version above
   was itself derived from NetBSD's internal utility implementation,
   gettemp.c.  This file is used only by the test programs, and
   only on those platforms that do not provide mkdtemp() (namely,
   mingw and msvc).  The full text of the applicable BSD license
   is embedded in the source file, and is also available in
   licenses/mkdtemp.
