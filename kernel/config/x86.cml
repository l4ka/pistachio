#
# X86 specific kernel configurations
#

X86_SMALL_SPACES	'Small address spaces' text
Small address spaces is an optimization that emulates tagged TLBs (and
tagged virtual caches in general) using the segmentation facility in
the IA-32 processors.  It can greatly reduce the costs associated with
address space switching.
.

#
#  IO Fpages for X86 processors
#


X86_IO_FLEXPAGES	'IO Flexpages' text
Enable support for IO port protection via fpages.
.


#
#  X86_COMPATIBILITY_MODE specific kernel configuration
#

X86_COMPATIBILITY_MODE 	'Enable 32-bit Compatibility Mode' text 
Enable support for X64 32-bit Compatibility Mode. In a kernel with
Compatibility Mode enabled, most existing 32-bit x86 applications will
run without modification.
.


#
# X86 specific debug configurations
#

X86_KEEP_LAST_BRANCHES	'Keep last branch' text
Keep the state of the last-branch model specific registers upon
exceptions and enter kdebug instructions.  Useful for seeing where the
last branch occured in user level (e.g., where a branch to an invalid
instruction occured).

Enabling this will incur some overhead during exception/interrupt
handling.
.

#
#  Flushfilter for AMD K8 processors
#

K8_FLUSHFILTER  'Enable K8 Flush Filter' text 
Enable the K8 flush filter functionality, which (in some cases)
prevents the TLB from being flushed on a context switch. Be warned
that, in case of SMP, AMD suggests to turn off the flush filter for
some processor revisions.
.
